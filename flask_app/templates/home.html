              <h3>About Me</h3>
              I recently graduated from Michigan State University with a degree
               in Computer Science through the College of Engineering with a 
               concentration in Software Engineering and a minor in Business 
              through the Eli Broad College of Business.

              I worked as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for 
              MSU's CSE 102. The class is a python-based programming class to 
              teach coding and problem-solving to beginner coders.

              I previously completed an internship for a small consulting company 
              where I was a sales analyst intern. I was part of a team that 
              selected a sales vertical to build out full operations for in a new
              market segmentation. This included data scraping, implementing a 
              CRM, and designing workflows.

              I am eager to obtain a position that will allow me to utilize and 
              showcase my strong communication, logic, leadership, and 
              problem-solving abilities.
